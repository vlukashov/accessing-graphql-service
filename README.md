# Consuming GraphQL example with Java, Spring Boot & Vaadin

This example app shows how to consume trivial data from a GraphQL API.
The GraphQL API is provided by [StepZen](https://stepzen.com), and is based on the `https://ip-api.com` IP Geolocation service.

The example app looks like this:

## Running the application
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvn`, then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/install) (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Deploying to Production
To create a production build, call `mvn clean package -Pproduction`.
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (NOTE, replace 
`myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the name of your jar).

## Project structure

- `MainView.java` in `src/main/java` is an example Vaadin view.
- `src/main/resources` contains configuration files and static resources
- The `frontend` directory in the root folder is where client-side 
  dependencies and resource files should be placed.
